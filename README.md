## YT-Transcripts

YT-Transcripts is a tool that allows users to easily copy transcripts from YouTube videos.

YT-Transcripts cleans up the YouTube generated transcripts by removing time stamps and faulty translations.

## Implementation

As of June 2021, YT-transcripts is still in early development. We plan to release the final product as a Chrome extension.
